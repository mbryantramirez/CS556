      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The "intro" lab is an introduction to DETER and some basic UNIX
        utilities. </p>
      <p>The lab itself has four parts: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Obtain a DETER account and then create/swap in your intro
          experiment.</li>
        <li>Use the command line to find five hidden JPG images.</li>
        <li>Use the Internet to find answers to a few simple questions.</li>
        <li>Make a "tar ball" of your answers and the images, and submit
          it to your instructor.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Finally, in addition to completing the lab, we recommend you
        spend some additional time playing around with utilities and
        reading <tt>man</tt> pages if you are unsure of your UNIX or
        command-line skills. You are welcome to use DETER for this
        purpose. </p>
      <p><span class="anchor" id="reading"></span> </p>
      <h2>Required Reading</h2>
      <span class="anchor" id="deterinst"></span>
      <h3>DETER Instructions</h3>
      <p>In order to complete this lab, you'll need to follow the
        instructions for <a
href="http://www.cs.colostate.edu/%7Ecs556/projects/project-1/DETERintro.html">getting

          a DETER account and swapping in experiments</a>. You'll also
        need to learn a few things about the Unix command line (if you
        don't already know them). </p>
      <div dir="ltr" id="content" lang="en"><span class="anchor"
          id="top"></span>
        <p>In this section, we will briefly discuss how to use the tools
          you <em>may</em> need to complete these labs. Most of these
          tools are very well documented. Your first reference should be
          the <tt>man</tt> page for the tool, usually accessed by
          executing <tt>man&nbsp;program</tt> on the command line.
          However, these tools are so fundamental to the command line
          that many of them have extensive documentation, tips, and
          tutorials available online. Google is your friend. </p>
        <p><span class="anchor" id="ssh"></span> </p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Secure Shell and Copy</h3>
        <p>SSH is short for Secure Shell, an encrypted, remote, command
          line terminal client. SCP is short for Secure Copy, and is
          used to transfer files from host to host using encrypted
          channels. Since you will use SSH and SCP to interact with
          DETER, your first step should be to read DETER's<a
            href="http://www.cs.colostate.edu/%7Ecs556/projects/project-1/ssh.html">
            introduction to SSH and SCP for students</a>. <span
            class="anchor" id="shell"></span> </p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>the Unix shell</h3>
        <p> The Unix shell is the precursor to almost all modern
          "command line interfaces". When you ssh into DETER, you'll be
          using a "shell." Because similar interfaces are so common
          across many systems, we'll start by providing a translation
          key for common activities: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>change directories: <tt>cd&nbsp;[directory]]</tt> </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>list files in directory: <tt>ls&nbsp;[directory]</tt> </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>move/rename file: <tt>mv&nbsp;oldfile&nbsp;newfile</tt>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>copy a file: <tt>cp&nbsp;oldfile&nbsp;newfile</tt> </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>delete a file: <tt>rm&nbsp;file</tt> </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>remove an empty directory: <tt>rmdir&nbsp;directory</tt>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>create an empty directory: <tt>mkdir&nbsp;directory</tt>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>read a file: <em>see below</em> </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>kill a process: <tt>^C</tt> (control-C) </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>stop a process: <tt>^Z</tt> (control-Z) </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>restart a stopped process: <tt>fg</tt> </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>pause the terminal output: <tt>^S</tt> (control-S) </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>resume the terminal output: <tt>^Q</tt> (control-Q) </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>... and many more. Most of these commands also have
          additional options. See <tt>man&nbsp;command_name</tt> for
          more information. </p>
        <p>While this serves as a basic introduction, the shell's
          advanced features are too complicated to describe here. </p>

            Rosenblatt -- although it is much more advanced than you
            will need for the typical exercises on DETER. </p>
        </div>
        <span class="anchor" id="man">
          <h3>the Unix manual: the hitchiker's guide to Unix</h3>
          <p> <tt>man</tt>, the Unix manual, is where all the "help
            files" live in Unix. Practically every command has a helpful
            man page, which you can access by typing <tt>man&nbsp;command_name</tt>.
            It should be your first stop when looking for info about how
            tools work. </p>
          <div class="infobox">
            <p><img src="idea.png">A few handy key strokes for perusing
              manpages: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>space goes forward a page </li>
              <li>return goes forward a line </li>
              <li>b goes back a page </li>
              <li>/ searches forwards </li>
              <li>? searches backwards </li>
              <li>q quits </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p> Learning to read man pages is a skill. First, spend some
            time getting to know the general format: a one-line
            description, followed by a syntax synopsis (items in square
            brackets are optional), longer description, options, other
            arguments, various other documentation, optional examples,
            and references. If you're looking for a command-line switch
            to do something, chances are it should be in the first few
            sections of the manpage. Or, skip to the end and see if any
            examples do what you want. In any case, practice with "/"
            and "?" to search for text. </p>
          <p>For example, suppose you were reading the manpage for <tt>find</tt>
            and you wanted to know how to keep <tt>find</tt> from
            looking in other filesystems connected to the machine (such
            as network drives). The manpage for <tt>find</tt> is over
            1,000 lines! Who has time to read the whole thing? However,
            if you use the "/" forward search key and enter
            "filesystem," the second match is for the command-line
            switch to do just that (<tt>-mount</tt>). </p>
          <p></p>
          <h4>Other sources of information</h4>
          <p> If a tool doesn't have a man page, or you'd like some
            different information, the following usually works: </p>
          <p><tt>$&nbsp;command_name&nbsp;-h&nbsp;(or&nbsp;--help)</tt>
          </p>
          <p>This will often print out a useful page of information. If
            there is too much output to read, try using one of the
            pagers (e.g. <tt>more</tt> or <tt>less</tt>) described
            below. </p>
          <p>If you still need more help, search online. Or, email your
            instructor, TA, or friendly neighborhood Unix guru. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p><span class="anchor" id="sudo"></span> </p>
          <p></p>
          <h3>sudo: superuser do</h3>
          <p> <a class="http" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo">sudo</a>
            is a Unix command meaning "superuser do" and gives
            unprivileged users access to privileged commands. If you try
            to do something and it says <tt>Permission denied</tt>, try
            again -- this time, put <tt>sudo</tt> in front of the
            command. </p>
          <div class="infobox">
            <p><tt>sudo</tt> is essentially a setuid-root program that
              interprets its own expressive ACL to determine which
              actions should be allowed. If you don't know what that
              means now, don't worry -- you will later. </p>
          </div>
          <p> The most simple use of <tt>sudo</tt> is to give a user
            (such as the primary user of a Linux system) full access to
            root abilities. In order to exercise those abilities, the
            user executes the command through sudo like this: </p>
          <p></p>
          <pre>$ sudo shutdown -r now<br>Password: [user's password]<br><br>This system is going down for a reboot NOW!<br>Connection closed by foreign host.<br></pre>
          <p> This command (to reboot a Linux server immediately)
            typically requires root access. Without <tt>sudo</tt>, a
            user would have to become root using the command <tt>su</tt>
            (switch user): </p>
          <p></p>
          <pre>$ su -<br>Password: [root's password]<br>[ROOT $] shutdown -r now<br>This machine is going down for a reboot NOW!!!<br></pre>
          <p> But this requires that the unprivileged user knows root's
            password, which undermines any concept of real privilege or
            security. Instead, <tt>sudo</tt> requires the user to enter
            <em>their own password</em>, which serves to prove that
            their terminal has not been taken over. The <tt>sudo</tt>
            ACL is then interpreted to ensure that the user has the
            permission to execute the command entered, at which point it
            is executed as root. </p>
          <p>Typically, the user enters their password the first time
            they use <tt>sudo</tt> in a session (it actually "times
            out" in around 15 minutes). Sometimes, systems are set up
            (like DETER's experimental nodes) where <tt>sudo</tt> does
            not require a password. This can be dangerous; one of the
            nice features of the password prompt is to make sure that
            you really mean to execute something as root. </p>
          <p><tt>sudo</tt> can lock down individual commands; this is
            necessary for real security. For example, a user can be
            given access to run a particular program as root but no root
            access to any other actions. Due to the expressiveness of
            the ACL, it is very easy to inadvertently create an insecure
            ACL allowing a user unintended access through <tt>sudo</tt>.
            For example, on DETER you can enter <tt>sudo&nbsp;su&nbsp;-</tt>
            to assume <tt>root</tt> without knowing <tt>root</tt>'s
            password. You can also enter <tt>sudo&nbsp;passwd&nbsp;root</tt>
            and change <tt>root</tt>'s password. In the case of DETER
            this is by design -- but obviously in other environments it
            would represent the worst kind of security breach, because
            once an attacker has acquired root access there is <em>no
              way to know the system is secure</em> without wiping and
            reinstalling or validating every single piece of software on
            the system. (Why?) Therefore it is important that
            administrators make sure their <tt>sudo</tt> ACLs are well
            written and secure. </p>
          <div class="warning">
            <p><img src="alert.png">If an attacker has root access, he
              or she can change literally anything that is changeable on
              the system, including modifying the kernel, executables,
              compilers, system tools, and so on. Common modifications
              include changing the tools that would normally be used to
              detect modifications! Because of this, it is extremely
              difficult to verify that a system has been "secured"
              following an attack. As a result, the "best practice" is
              to wipe the system to the "bare metal," including
              reformatting the hard drive and reinstalling the operating
              system and data from trusted media. </p>

            is a <tt>sudo</tt> manpage, many online tutorials, and even
            a <tt>sudoers</tt> manpage for the ACL file, featuring a

          <pre>$ sudo cat /var/log/messages</pre>
          <p> ... will print the file /var/log/messages to screen as
            fast as your connection will allow. <tt>cat</tt> terminates
            at the end of the file. You can also quit <tt>cat</tt> by
            pressing <tt>^C</tt> (Control-C). </p>
          <p>Most of the time, however, you want to control how much of
            a file you see. The following tools help you do just that. </p>
          <h4>less</h4>
          <p> <tt>less</tt> is the better replacement for the Unix file
            pager <tt>more</tt>. To use <tt>less</tt>, enter: </p>
          <p></p>
          <pre>$ less /var/log/messages</pre>
          <p>... or </p>
          <pre>$ cat /var/log/messages | less</pre>
          <p> And you will be greeted by the top of the system log. To
            move up and down in the file, you can use the arrow keys, or
            page up, page down, home, and end. You can also search
            within the loaded file using the / (search forward) and ?
            (search backward) command, like this: </p>
          <p></p>
          <pre>...<br>xxx.105.166.xxx - - [02/Sep/2007:07:15:32 -0700] "GET /foo/SomePage HTTP/1.1" 200 15289<br>xxx.105.166.xxx - - [02/Sep/2007:07:17:23 -0700] "GET /foo/ HTTP/1.1" 200 16557<br>/SomePage&lt;enter&gt;<br></pre>
          <p> Note the bottom line, <tt>/SomePage&lt;enter&gt;</tt>.
            When you press "/" (the search forward key), less will print
            it at the bottom, and wait for you to enter a search string.
            When you're finished, press enter. This will jump to the
            first and highlight all occurances of the string "SomePage".
            To see the next result, press "/" again and hit enter. In
            this way, you can cycle through all occurrences of a string
            in a text file. The command "?" works exactly like "/" but
            searches backwards. Both ? and / accept <a class="http"
              href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular

              expressions</a> (also known as regexes) in addition to
            normal strings -- if you know regexes you can create vastly
            more expressive search patterns. </p>
          <p>Hit q to quit <tt>less</tt>. </p>
          <p></p>
          <h4>tail and head</h4>
          <p> <tt>tail</tt> and <tt>head</tt> respectively print out
            the last 10 and first 10 lines of their input file.
            Typically, <tt>tail</tt> is used to check the end of a
            file, but it is also very commonly used to "watch" a log
            file. Using the command: </p>
          <p></p>
          <pre>$ sudo tail -f /var/log/messages</pre>
          <p> ... you can watch the messages file grow. ^C quits. </p>
          <p></p>
          <h4>grep</h4>
          <p> <tt>grep</tt> is what makes <tt>cat</tt> useful in this
            context. <tt>grep</tt> is a filter that uses patterns
            (including regexes) to filter lines of input. For example,
            given the snippet of the messages file from before, if a
            user "pipes" the output of <tt>cat</tt> into <tt>grep</tt>
            and filters for "xxx.55.121.xxx" like this: </p>
          <p></p>
          <pre>$ cat /var/log/messages | grep xxx.55.121.xxx</pre>
          <p> ... she will see only lines matching xxx.55.121.xxx: </p>
          <p></p>
          <pre>...<br>Sep  5 21:49:08 localhost postfix/smtpd[19090]: connect from unknown[xxx.55.121.xxx]<br>Sep  5 21:49:10 localhost postfix/smtpd[19090]: lost connection after CONNECT from unknown[xxx.55.121.xxx]<br>Sep  5 21:49:10 localhost postfix/smtpd[19090]: disconnect from unknown[xxx.55.121.xxx]<br>...<br></pre>
          <p> If there is still too much output, just pipe the output
            from <tt>grep</tt> into <tt>less</tt>, like this: </p>
          <p></p>
          <pre>$ cat /var/log/messages | grep kernel | less</pre>
          <p> ... and now you can use the features of <tt>less</tt> to
            examine your result. </p>
          <p>As an alternative, you can use <i>command line redirection</i>
            to send the output to a file like so: </p>
          <p></p>
          <pre>$ cat /var/log/messages | grep kernel &gt; kernel_grep.txt</pre>
          <p> ... You can then use <tt>less</tt> on the file <tt>kernel_grep.txt</tt>
            you just created. </p>
          <p><tt>grep</tt> has many advanced features, such as negation
            (<tt>grep&nbsp;-v&nbsp;somestring</tt>). For more
            information see <tt>grep</tt>'s manpage. <span

          <h3>find, xargs, and locate: find files</h3>
          <p> Users of more "user friendly" operating systems such as
            Windows and OS X are spoiled when it comes to finding local
            files, because while the graphical tools like Windows find,
            Apple's Spotlight Search, and Google Desktop are fast and
            easy to use, they are generally not nearly as flexible or
            expressive as the standard Unix utilities for finding files,
            <tt>find</tt>, <tt>xargs</tt>, and/or <tt>locate</tt>. </p>
          <p></p>
          <h4>find -- find files on the system</h4>
          <p> <tt>find</tt> can be used to search for files of various
            names and sizes, various modification times, access
            permissions, and much, much more. However, the syntax for <tt>find</tt>
            is a black art into which most of its users are barely
            initiated. We'll discuss the basics here so you can use it.
            If you want to know more, read the manpage or look online. </p>
          <p>The basic command format is "<tt>find&nbsp;[path&nbsp;[expression]</tt>",
where

            'path' is the directory to start searching in and <tt>expression</tt>
            is some compound expression made up of <em>options</em>, <em>tests</em>,
            <em>actions</em>, and <em>operators</em>. The expression
            modifies the search behavior: <em>options</em> specify
            things like how many levels deep to search, whether to
            follow symlinks, whether to traverse filesystem boundaries,
            etc. <em>Tests</em> specify conditions like matches on the
            filename, modification date, size, etc. <em>Actions</em>
            can be defined to delete matching files, print the files, or
            execute arbitrary commands. (The default action is to print
            the name of any match.) <em>Operators</em> are logical
            operators for combining multiple expressions. Expressions
            limit results. Accordingly, no expression at all will
            "match" everything and the default action will print the
            relative paths of all files that <tt>find</tt> encouters. </p>
          <p>You usually don't want to list every file in a subtree. In
            this case you may want to limit the search with an
            expression. An expression begins with the first of several
            expression options that begin with a hyphen (such as <tt>-name</tt>
            or <tt>-mtime</tt>) or other special characters. The
            expression can also specify actions to take on any matching
            files (such as to delete them). Expressions can become very
            complicated. And like any complicated machine, the more
            complicated the expression, the more likely it is that <tt>find</tt>
            will not do exactly what you want. If you need to create
            expressions beyond the complexity addressed here, please see
            <tt>man find</tt> or a tutorial online and try examples on
            your own. </p>
          <p>Here are a few simple examples to get you started: </p>
          <p>"Find all files ending with .txt, starting in this
            directory. Use <tt>head</tt> to show me only the first 5
            results." </p>
          <p></p>
          <pre>$ find . -name "*.txt" | head -n 5</pre>
          <p> "Find all files ending with "~" or ".swp" (common tempfile
            designations), starting in the subdirectory <tt>public_html</tt>."

            To do this, we'll use the OR operator <tt>-o</tt>. </p>
          <p></p>
          <pre>$ find public_html -name "*.swp" -o -name "*~"</pre>
          <p> "Find all files on the root filesystem not modified in 6
            years (2190 days). Start in the root directory (/), and do
            not descend into other filesystems (such as NFS
            directories). Use head to only show the first 5 results." </p>
          <p></p>
          <pre>$ find / -mount -mtime 2190 | head -n 5</pre>
          <p> Finally, here's an example from <tt>man&nbsp;find</tt>: </p>
          <p></p>
          <pre>$ find /    \( -perm -4000 -fprintf /root/suid.txt Åf%#m %u %p\nÅf \) , \<br>             \( -size +100M -fprintf /root/big.txt Åf%-10s %p\nÅf \)<br></pre>
          <p> This translates to: "Traverse the filesystem just once,
            listing setuid files and directories into /root/suid.txt and
            large files into /root/big.txt." (<tt>man&nbsp;find</tt>) </p>
          <div class="infobox">
            <p><img src="idea.png">The backslashes ("\") in the above
              example are called "escapes." Backslash escaping tells the
              shell either to treat the escaped character literally --
              not as a a special character -- or vice versa (that a
              regular character has a special meaning). Above, the
              parentheses are escaped because they are input for <tt>find</tt>.
              If they were not escaped, the shell would interpret them
              in its own way, because parentheses are special for the
              shell. Similarly, a line break created by pressing enter
              signifies the end of a command -- unless it is escaped.
              Here, the line break (visible as the backslash at the end
              of a line) is escaped to tell the shell that the command
              is continuing on the next line. Finally, an escaped "n"
              character, (<tt>\n</tt>) represents a line break in
              printf-style format strings. </p>
            <p>Be careful with advanced uses of <tt>find</tt>,
              especially if you are deleting files. As you might
              imagine, unexpected things often happen when shell
              escapes, quoting and expansion are involved. </p>
          </div>
          <p> Finally, because find performs a depth-first search over
            potentially the entire filesystem tree, it can take a long
            time to run. You may have better luck with <tt>locate</tt>
            depending on what you're trying to do. (See below.) </p>
          <p></p>
          <h4>xargs -- build command lines from standard input</h4>
          <p> In the Unix environment, the output of one program can be
            easily redirected (or "piped") into the input of another
            program. <tt>xargs</tt> allows you to use the output of one
            program as <em>arguments</em> to another process. This is
            very useful in conjunction with tools like <tt>find</tt>, <tt>cat</tt>,
            and <tt>grep</tt>. As with everything in the LabTools
            document, this is only a brief introduction to <tt>xargs</tt>
            -- for more information, please see <tt>man&nbsp;xargs</tt>.
          </p>
          <p>The most common use of <tt>xargs</tt> is to take the
            output from a command and use it as a parameter in a
            different command. For example: </p>
          <p>"Run <tt>strings</tt> on every file on the system that
            ends with ".pwd" (case insensitive) and sort the results
            ASCIIbetically." </p>
          <p></p>
          <pre>$ find / -iname "*.pwd" | xargs strings $1 | sort</pre>
          <p> The output of <tt>find</tt> is used by <tt>xargs</tt> to
            construct the <tt>strings</tt> command. After this, the
            output of <tt>strings</tt> is put into a different order by
            <tt>sort</tt>. </p>
          <p>Here's another example: </p>
          <p>"Delete the first four files ending in ".swp" or "~" that
            have not been modified in 24 days starting in this
            directory." </p>
          <p></p>
          <pre>find . -mount -mtime +24 \( -name "*.swp" -o -name "*~" \) | head -n 4 | xargs rm $1</pre>
          <p> Note the use of <tt>head</tt> to limit the action.
            Without <tt>head&nbsp;-n&nbsp;4</tt>, <tt>xargs</tt> would
            have removed every matching file. </p>
          <p></p>
          <h4>locate -- a faster way to search</h4>
          <p> <tt>find</tt> does not keep a database of information to
            use; every time you run a new invocation of <tt>find</tt>,
            it traverses the entire directory structure looking for
            matches. This allows you to search the current state of the
            system, but also lacks the advantages that pre-indexing and
            caching can provide. <tt>locate</tt> and its helper command
            <tt>updatedb</tt> are more like Google Desktop than Unix <tt>find</tt>
            in this sense. </p>
          <p><strong> Before using <tt>locate</tt>, <tt>updatedb</tt>
              must be run as root to index the entire disk, recording it
              in a database.</strong> Then, the <tt>locate</tt> command
            is used with a few simple options to match filenames. This
            can be <em>much</em> faster than using <tt>find</tt>,
            especially if you don't know exactly what you're looking for
            or where it might be. As always, see <tt>man&nbsp;locate</tt>
            for more information. To update the locate database, run: </p>
          <p></p>
          <pre>$ sudo updatedb</pre>
          <p> <tt>sudo</tt> is used to make sure that you have
            permission to read the entire disk. </p>
          <p>The following examples assume that updatedb has been run as
            root recently: </p>
          <p>"Find all files ending in '~' or '.swp'." </p>
          <p></p>
          <pre>$ sudo locate *~ *.swp</pre>
          <p> "Find all files ending in '~' or '.swp' and delete them."
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <pre>$ sudo locate *~ *.swp | xargs rm $1</pre>
          <p> <tt>locate</tt> will complete the search for the first
            term and then the second term. So an example like this: </p>
          <p>"Find all files ending in '~' or '.swp' and delete the
            first 10 results." </p>
          <p></p>
          <pre>$ sudo locate *~ *.swp | head | xargs rm $1</pre>
          <p> Will only delete ".swp" files if there were <em>less</em>
            than 10 "~" files (since the "~" files are returned first).
          </p>
          <p><tt>sudo</tt> is used in the locate commands to make sure
            that you are able to access all of the <tt>locate</tt>
            database. </p>

          <h3>tar</h3>
          <p> </p>
          <h4>tar -- Tape Archiver</h4>
          <p> tar is an ancient program, reflected in the meaning of its
            name -- tape archiver -- from when backups were primarily
            performed on magnetic tape. </p>
          <p>The tar manpage includes a lot of information, but I'll
            just give some example usage: </p>
          <p>To create a <tt>tar</tt> archive (also called a "tar file"
            or "tarball") of an entire directory, execute: </p>
          <p></p>
          <pre>$ tar cvzf somedir.tar.gz somedir</pre>
          <p> In the above example, there are a number of switches: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>c -- create archive </li>
            <li>v -- be verbose </li>
            <li>z -- compress (adds gzip (gz) compression) </li>
            <li>f -- tells tar that you're going to provide the filename
              next </li>
          </ul>
          <p>In this case, <tt>somedir.tar.gz</tt> (the first
            parameter) is the file to be created, and <tt>somedir</tt>
            (second parameter) is the directory being compressed. </p>
          <p>To decompress a tar file, do something like this: </p>
          <p></p>
          <pre>$ tar xvzf somedir.tar.gz</pre>
          <p> In this example, the x stands for extract; the other
            switches are the same. </p>
          <p><span class="anchor" id="screen"></span> </p>

          <h3>screen: terminal multiplexer and manager</h3>
          <p> <a class="http"
              href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen">screen</a>
            is a terminal multiplexer with many features. Typically,
            when a user disconnects from a system, all their running
            processes terminate -- <tt>screen</tt> allows users to keep
            those programs running in such a way that the user can
            reconnect to them. Screen also allows users to have multiple

            <li>disconnecting from a system but leaving your programs
              running in such a way that you can reconnect to them </li>
            <li>share a screen between two users </li>
            <li>cut and paste </li>
            <li>multiple terminals "inside" one terminal window </li>
          </ul>
          <p><tt>screen</tt> functions as a very simple window manager
            for terminal sessions. As such, all programs are run <em>inside</em>
            <tt>screen</tt>, which itself runs inside one terminal
            window (such as PuTTY, Gnome Terminal, or Terminal.app).
            Control sequences (starting with Control-a) are used to
            issue commands to <tt>screen</tt>. </p>
          <p>For example, to start a large software compilation and
            detach your terminal, one could enter these commands: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>screen <em>(this starts the program screen and a
                  terminal inside of it)</em> </p>
              <ul>
                <li>$ make bigsoftwareproject (this will take a while) </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Control-a, d <em>(detach this screen)</em> </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>exit <em>(log out of the system)</em> </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p> Later, the user can log back in to the system and type: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>screen -r -d <em>(detach and pick up a screen session)</em>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>... Now the user is back where they left off, and the
              software is compiling in the background.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Control-a c <em>(create a new window)</em> </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>$ less somefile.txt <em>(The user looks at a file
                      inside less)</em> </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Control-a 0 <em>(The user switches back to screen
                      0 where "bigsoftwareproject" is still building) </em>
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>... (It's still building...)<em> </em> </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Control-a 1 (The user switches back to screen 1
                    where they are reading somefile.txt)<em> </em> </p>
                </li>
                <li>... etc. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>For example, a user can keep an IRC window, mail client,
            software build, <a href="#top">top</a> system monitor, <a
              href="#iptraf">iptraf</a> monitor, and more running on a
            system as long as the system stays up. The user can access
            the <tt>screen</tt> session, interact, and disconnect from
            the session with the ability to log back in to the system
            and pick up where he or she left off. </p>
          <p><tt>screen</tt> also allows you to copy and paste in
            between windows and scroll back. In order to use this
            functionality, enter <tt>Control-a&nbsp;ESC</tt>, followed
            by the arrow keys to navigate the cursor. Press ENTER to
            make the first mark, move the cursor, and press ENTER again
            to select and copy the text. To paste it at the cursor
            location, press <tt>Control-a&nbsp;]</tt>. Because screen
            has a large scrollbuffer, the copy function can be used to
            scroll back long distances, which is useful for reviewing
            past information. To leave copy mode without selecting any
            text, hit ENTER twice. </p>

          </p>
          <p>Vim is "vi-improved" and is based on <tt>vi</tt>, written
            by Bill Joy in 1976. <tt>vi</tt> is a modal editor (which
            means you are typically either in insert or command mode but
            never both simultaneously). To enter insert mode for
            entering text, press <tt>i</tt> or the <tt>Insert</tt> key
            on your computer. (<tt>vim</tt> will enter Replace mode
            (i.e. overwrite) if you press <tt>Insert</tt> twice). To
            leave insert mode and enter command mode, press <tt>Escape</tt>.
          </p>
          <p> <tt>vi</tt> is part of the <a class="http"
              href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX">POSIX</a>
            standard for Unix, so some version of <tt>vi</tt> (e.g., <tt>vi</tt>,
            <tt>nvi</tt>, <tt>elvis</tt>, <tt>vim</tt> ...) should be
            available on all Unix-like systems everywhere. Vim has
            greatly extended features such as split screens, syntax
            highlighting, and much more. <tt>vi</tt> is often lauded
            for doing one thing and doing it well -- on the other hand,
            it is sometimes criticized for this limitation, and many
            users dislike modal editing. New users sometimes find <tt>vi</tt>
            confusing. </p>
          <p><strong>How to quit vim</strong> </p>
          <p>To quit vim, hit <tt>escape</tt> (to enter command mode),
            then enter </p>
          <p><tt>:wq</tt> </p>
          <p>This stands for write and quit -- just <tt>:w</tt> writes
            without quitting (a.k.a "saving"), <tt>:q</tt> quits a
            blank document, and <tt>:q!</tt> quits a document with
            unsaved changes. Finally, <tt>:w!</tt> writes a "write
            protected" file that you have the permission to change. </p>

M.

              Stallman</a> at MIT, Emacs is first a text editor, but it
            is much more. Emacs is incredibly extensible; it features a
            built in version of the Lisp language, and many external
            libraries and applications exist to add functionality. With
            the standard and extended features, Emacs can be and do so
            many things that some people think of Emacs almost as its
            own operating system. Advanced functionality includes: gdb
            debugger interface, diff, gnus email client, web browser,
            file browser, tetris, and pong! Emacs is appreciated for its
            power and unparalleled extensibility, but is often
            criticized for being bloated or for trying to do "too much".
            New users sometimes find Emacs confusing. </p>

            <tt>nano</tt> is very similar to familiar text editors such

            and Perl. <tt>ed</tt> is terse <em>in the extreme</em>, a
            design feature that was logical in the days of 110 baud
            [slow!] terminals and remote connections, but which today
            seems alien, unfriendly, and unbelievably obtuse.
            Nonetheless, <tt>ed</tt> is even more universal than <tt>vi</tt>
